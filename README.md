## Reflection :bulb:
  - What was the context for this project? 
    > This app is a side project of mine, developed in order to consolidate the knowledge I aquired during the WebDev Bootcamp at Ironhack.
  - What did I set out to build? 
    > My goal is to create a functional social network that allows people to interact with each other and check for interesting and relevant content. 
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
    > I have been trying to implement interesting features and use other resources that I had never worked with before. 
  - What tools did I use to implement this project? 
    >I used the Create-React-App command to set the baseline of the project; Also, I used Redux-toolkit to manage global state, and other NPM packages, such as Material UI, StyledComponents and React-Time-Ago. MongoDb was the chosen DB to work with.
