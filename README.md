## Project Status :writing_hand:

This project is currently in development. The goal is to create a social network platform with all the features commonly found on this type of apps.

At this moment, one can join Poly through Google authentication or the signup/login forms.

Once logged in, the user is able to create, edit, like and comment the posts. The user can also check his/her profile and edit it, and check other user's profile and full activity history. 

If not logged in, the user is able to check the existing content, but cannot interact with it. The user can check other user's profiles and see this one's latest activity history as well.

## Reflection :bulb:
  - What was the context for this project? 
    > This app is a side project of mine, developed in order to consolidate the knowledge I aquired during the WebDev Bootcamp at Ironhack.
  - What did I set out to build? 
    > My goal is to create a functional social network that allows people to interact with each other and check for interesting and relevant content. 
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
    > I have been trying to implement interesting features and use other resources that I had never worked with before. 
  - What tools did I use to implement this project? 
    >I used the Create-React-App command to set the baseline of the project; Also, I used Redux-toolkit to manage global state, and other NPM packages, such as Material UI, StyledComponents and React-Time-Ago. MongoDb was the chosen DB to work with. I also implemented google authentication supported by firebase.
